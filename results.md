# Interpretation of Visualization
Here a short explanation and interpretation of the given visualizations.

## Key Aspects of Visualization
Here the most important information about each visualization are given

### Charging Station
1. High number of stations: **Mitte**, **Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg**, **Marzahn-Hellersdorf** and **Charlottenbug**
2. Low number of stations: **Zehlendorf**, **Spandau**, **Köpenick**
3. Missing data: there is some data missing in **Charlottenbug**, **Mitte**, **Heiligen See**/**Tegel**, **Pankow**,  **Lichtenrade**

### Residential 
1. High number of residents: **Mitte**, **Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg**, **Pankow**, West of **Spandau**, South of **Neu-Köllen**
2. Low number of residents: **Köpenick**, **Charlottenburg**, **Zehlendorf**, **Marzahn-Hellersdorf**


### Comparison of Geo-visualization

By comparing the two geo-visualizations of residents per area and charging-stations per area we can derive the following insights

1. **Charlottenburg**, has a high number of charging stations but not that many residents
2. on the contrary does **Spandau** and **Marzahn-Hellersdorf** have a high nuber of residents but a low number of charging stations


## Conclusion
The maps show that Berlin's charging stations are concentrated in the center, 
while the outer residential areas are underserved. To promote electric vehicle usage
and meet future demand, it is crucial to focus on building infrastructure in the outskirts, 
where the population is dense but facilities are lacking. <br>
It might also be insightful to look at the average income of the individual areas,
to see if the demand is there, since electric mobility is still expensive.
